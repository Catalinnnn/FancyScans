# FancyScans 
#### A Shaders + Basic scripts pair for Unity3D for animated scan lines over transparent geometry.

Possible uses: No Man's Sky like scan lines over terrain, as seen below:

This is basically just a version of the shader+script pair presented [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKoNp2RqE9A), which works with transparent geometry. 

Instead of using the depth buffer & an image effect for the scan lines, it just adds the scan lines to the object itself. 

Sample project with the scenes used to generate the gif in the **FancyScansSampleProject** folder. Relevant scripts & shaders in the **FancyScans** folder.

Enjoy!
